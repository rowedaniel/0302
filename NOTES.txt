     Full Color Array
            |
         Texture*
            |
          Sprite

* = saved in memory

notes:
Use texture.update() to change, bc it will change the texture while keeping the rest the same.
I think this way runs once/new texture + once/new colormap, which is superior to doing it once/frame for whole screen.
